# Static-Comp-2
This is my Static Comp 2 challenge web design.

# What is it?
This page is the 4th project for Turing MOD 1 students.

# What is the objective?
This is a project designed for students to continue to improve their basic HTML and CSS skills.

# The goals are as follows: 
To have a responsive, basic static site with index.html and styles.css. Site should work on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. Must use normalize in CSS instead of a reset file. Flex-box was allowed for use on this project.

# How it was made
Created with a combination of HMTL and CSS

# Coding Style
Standard HTML and CSS

# Challenges
Had trouble with the chart area, specifically adding the buttons to it. Some challenges when using the media queries to resize.

# Media Queries
Placed media queries at 870px, 728px, and 670px to adjust size and layout.
